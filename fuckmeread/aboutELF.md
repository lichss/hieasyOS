ELF(5)                                     File Formats Manual                                     ELF(5)

NAME
       elf - format of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) files

SYNOPSIS
       #include <elf.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The  header  file  <elf.h> defines the format of ELF executable binary files.  Amongst these files
       are normal executable files, relocatable object files, core files, and shared objects.

       An executable file using the ELF file format consists of an ELF  header,  followed  by  a  program
       header  table  or a section header table, or both.  The ELF header is always at offset zero of the
       file.  The program header table and the section header table's offset in the file are  defined  in
       the ELF header.  The two tables describe the rest of the particularities of the file.

       This  header  file  describes the above mentioned headers as C structures and also includes struc‐
       tures for dynamic sections, relocation sections and symbol tables.

   Basic types
       The following types are used for N-bit architectures (N=32,64, ElfN stands  for  Elf32  or  Elf64,
       uintN_t stands for uint32_t or uint64_t):

           ElfN_Addr       Unsigned program address, uintN_t
           ElfN_Off        Unsigned file offset, uintN_t
           ElfN_Section    Unsigned section index, uint16_t
           ElfN_Versym     Unsigned version symbol information, uint16_t
           Elf_Byte        unsigned char
           ElfN_Half       uint16_t
           ElfN_Sword      int32_t
           ElfN_Word       uint32_t
           ElfN_Sxword     int64_t
           ElfN_Xword      uint64_t

       (Note:  the  *BSD  terminology  is  a  bit  different.   There,  Elf64_Half  is  twice as large as
       Elf32_Half, and Elf64Quarter is used for uint16_t.  In order to avoid confusion  these  types  are
       replaced by explicit ones in the below.)

       All  data  structures  that the file format defines follow the "natural" size and alignment guide‐
       lines for the relevant class.  If necessary, data structures contain explicit  padding  to  ensure
       4-byte alignment for 4-byte objects, to force structure sizes to a multiple of 4, and so on.

   ELF header (Ehdr)
       The ELF header is described by the type Elf32_Ehdr or Elf64_Ehdr:

           #define EI_NIDENT 16

           typedef struct {
               unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
               uint16_t      e_type;
               uint16_t      e_machine;
               uint32_t      e_version;
               ElfN_Addr     e_entry;
               ElfN_Off      e_phoff;
               ElfN_Off      e_shoff;
               uint32_t      e_flags;
               uint16_t      e_ehsize;
               uint16_t      e_phentsize;
               uint16_t      e_phnum;
               uint16_t      e_shentsize;
               uint16_t      e_shnum;
               uint16_t      e_shstrndx;
           } ElfN_Ehdr;

       The fields have the following meanings:

       e_ident
              This  array  of  bytes specifies how to interpret the file, independent of the processor or
              the file's remaining contents.  Within this array everything  is  named  by  macros,  which
              start with the prefix EI_ and may contain values which start with the prefix ELF.  The fol‐
              lowing macros are defined:

              EI_MAG0
                     The first byte of the magic number.  It must be filled with ELFMAG0.  (0: 0x7f)

              EI_MAG1
                     The second byte of the magic number.  It must be filled with ELFMAG1.  (1: 'E')

              EI_MAG2
                     The third byte of the magic number.  It must be filled with ELFMAG2.  (2: 'L')

              EI_MAG3
                     The fourth byte of the magic number.  It must be filled with ELFMAG3.  (3: 'F')

              EI_CLASS
                     The fifth byte identifies the architecture for this binary:

                     ELFCLASSNONE  This class is invalid.
                     ELFCLASS32    This defines the 32-bit architecture.  It supports machines with files
                                   and virtual address spaces up to 4 Gigabytes.
                     ELFCLASS64    This defines the 64-bit architecture.

              EI_DATA
                     The  sixth  byte  specifies  the data encoding of the processor-specific data in the
                     file.  Currently, these encodings are supported:

                       ELFDATANONE   Unknown data format.
                       ELFDATA2LSB   Two's complement, little-endian.
                       ELFDATA2MSB   Two's complement, big-endian.

              EI_VERSION
                     The seventh byte is the version number of the ELF specification:

                     EV_NONE       Invalid version.
                     EV_CURRENT    Current version.

              EI_OSABI
                     The eighth byte identifies the operating system and ABI to which the object is  tar‐
                     geted.   Some  fields  in other ELF structures have flags and values that have plat‐
                     form-specific meanings; the interpretation of those  fields  is  determined  by  the
                     value of this byte.  For example:

                     ELFOSABI_NONE        Same as ELFOSABI_SYSV
                     ELFOSABI_SYSV        UNIX System V ABI
                     ELFOSABI_HPUX        HP-UX ABI
                     ELFOSABI_NETBSD      NetBSD ABI
                     ELFOSABI_LINUX       Linux ABI
                     ELFOSABI_SOLARIS     Solaris ABI
                     ELFOSABI_IRIX        IRIX ABI
                     ELFOSABI_FREEBSD     FreeBSD ABI
                     ELFOSABI_TRU64       TRU64 UNIX ABI
                     ELFOSABI_ARM         ARM architecture ABI
                     ELFOSABI_STANDALONE  Stand-alone (embedded) ABI

              EI_ABIVERSION
                     The  ninth  byte  identifies the version of the ABI to which the object is targeted.
                     This field is used to distinguish among incompatible versions of an ABI.  The inter‐
                     pretation of this version number is dependent on the ABI identified by the  EI_OSABI
                     field.  Applications conforming to this specification use the value 0.

              EI_PAD Start  of  padding.   These bytes are reserved and set to zero.  Programs which read
                     them should ignore them.  The value for EI_PAD will change in  the  future  if  cur‐
                     rently unused bytes are given meanings.

              EI_NIDENT
                     The size of the e_ident array.

       e_type This member of the structure identifies the object file type:

              ET_NONE         An unknown type.
              ET_REL          A relocatable file.
              ET_EXEC         An executable file.
              ET_DYN          A shared object.
              ET_CORE         A core file.

       e_machine
              This member specifies the required architecture for an individual file.  For example:

              EM_NONE         An unknown machine
              EM_M32          AT&T WE 32100
              EM_SPARC        Sun Microsystems SPARC
              EM_386          Intel 80386
              EM_68K          Motorola 68000
              EM_88K          Motorola 88000
              EM_860          Intel 80860
              EM_MIPS         MIPS RS3000 (big-endian only)
              EM_PARISC       HP/PA
              EM_SPARC32PLUS  SPARC with enhanced instruction set
              EM_PPC          PowerPC
              EM_PPC64        PowerPC 64-bit
              EM_S390         IBM S/390
              EM_ARM          Advanced RISC Machines
              EM_SH           Renesas SuperH
              EM_SPARCV9      SPARC v9 64-bit
              EM_IA_64        Intel Itanium
              EM_X86_64       AMD x86-64
              EM_VAX          DEC Vax

       e_version
              This member identifies the file version:

              EV_NONE         Invalid version
              EV_CURRENT      Current version

       e_entry
              This  member  gives  the  virtual address to which the system first transfers control, thus
              starting the process.  If the file has no associated entry point, this member holds zero.

       e_phoff
              This member holds the program header table's file offset in bytes.  If the file has no pro‐
              gram header table, this member holds zero.

       e_shoff
              This member holds the section header table's file offset in bytes.  If the file has no sec‐
              tion header table, this member holds zero.

       e_flags
              This member holds processor-specific flags associated with the file.  Flag names  take  the
              form EF_`machine_flag'.  Currently, no flags have been defined.

       e_ehsize
              This member holds the ELF header's size in bytes.

       e_phentsize
              This  member  holds  the size in bytes of one entry in the file's program header table; all
              entries are the same size.

       e_phnum
              This member holds the number of entries in the program header table.  Thus the  product  of
              e_phentsize  and e_phnum gives the table's size in bytes.  If a file has no program header,
              e_phnum holds the value zero.

              If the number of entries in the program header table is larger than  or  equal  to  PN_XNUM
              (0xffff),  this member holds PN_XNUM (0xffff) and the real number of entries in the program
              header table is held in the sh_info member of the initial entry in  section  header  table.
              Otherwise, the sh_info member of the initial entry contains the value zero.

              PN_XNUM
                     This is defined as 0xffff, the largest number e_phnum can have, specifying where the
                     actual number of program headers is assigned.

       e_shentsize
              This  member holds a sections header's size in bytes.  A section header is one entry in the
              section header table; all entries are the same size.

       e_shnum
              This member holds the number of entries in the section header table.  Thus the  product  of
              e_shentsize  and  e_shnum gives the section header table's size in bytes.  If a file has no
              section header table, e_shnum holds the value of zero.

              If the number of entries in the section header table is larger than or equal  to  SHN_LORE‐
              SERVE  (0xff00), e_shnum holds the value zero and the real number of entries in the section
              header table is held in the sh_size member of the initial entry in  section  header  table.
              Otherwise,  the  sh_size  member of the initial entry in the section header table holds the
              value zero.

       e_shstrndx
              This member holds the section header table index of the entry associated with  the  section
              name  string  table.   If  the file has no section name string table, this member holds the
              value SHN_UNDEF.

              If the index of section name string table section is larger than or equal to  SHN_LORESERVE
              (0xff00),  this  member  holds  SHN_XINDEX  (0xffff) and the real index of the section name
              string table section is held in the sh_link member of the initial entry in  section  header
              table.  Otherwise, the sh_link member of the initial entry in section header table contains
              the value zero.

   Program header (Phdr)
       An  executable  or  shared  object file's program header table is an array of structures, each de‐
       scribing a segment or other information the system needs to prepare the program for execution.  An
       object file segment contains one or more sections.  Program headers are meaningful only  for  exe‐
       cutable  and  shared  object  files.   A  file  specifies its own program header size with the ELF
       header's e_phentsize and e_phnum members.  The  ELF  program  header  is  described  by  the  type
       Elf32_Phdr or Elf64_Phdr depending on the architecture:

           typedef struct {
               uint32_t   p_type;
               Elf32_Off  p_offset;
               Elf32_Addr p_vaddr;
               Elf32_Addr p_paddr;
               uint32_t   p_filesz;
               uint32_t   p_memsz;
               uint32_t   p_flags;
               uint32_t   p_align;
           } Elf32_Phdr;

           typedef struct {
               uint32_t   p_type;
               uint32_t   p_flags;
               Elf64_Off  p_offset;
               Elf64_Addr p_vaddr;
               Elf64_Addr p_paddr;
               uint64_t   p_filesz;
               uint64_t   p_memsz;
               uint64_t   p_align;
           } Elf64_Phdr;

       The  main  difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit program header lies in the location of the
       p_flags member in the total struct.

       p_type This member of the structure indicates what kind of segment this array element describes or
              how to interpret the array element's information.

                 PT_NULL
                        The array element is unused and the other members' values  are  undefined.   This
                        lets the program header have ignored entries.

                 PT_LOAD
                        The  array  element  specifies  a  loadable  segment,  described  by p_filesz and
                        p_memsz.  The bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory  seg‐
                        ment.   If  the  segment's  memory  size  p_memsz  is  larger  than the file size
                        p_filesz, the "extra" bytes are defined to hold the value 0  and  to  follow  the
                        segment's  initialized  area.   The  file  size may not be larger than the memory
                        size.  Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear  in  ascending
                        order, sorted on the p_vaddr member.

                 PT_DYNAMIC
                        The array element specifies dynamic linking information.

                 PT_INTERP
                        The  array  element specifies the location and size of a null-terminated pathname
                        to invoke as an interpreter.  This segment type is meaningful only for executable
                        files (though it may occur for shared objects).  However it may  not  occur  more
                        than  once in a file.  If it is present, it must precede any loadable segment en‐
                        try.

                 PT_NOTE
                        The array element specifies the location of notes (ElfN_Nhdr).

                 PT_SHLIB
                        This segment type is reserved but has unspecified semantics.  Programs that  con‐
                        tain an array element of this type do not conform to the ABI.

                 PT_PHDR
                        The  array  element,  if  present, specifies the location and size of the program
                        header table itself, both in the file and in the memory  image  of  the  program.
                        This segment type may not occur more than once in a file.  Moreover, it may occur
                        only  if the program header table is part of the memory image of the program.  If
                        it is present, it must precede any loadable segment entry.

                 PT_LOPROC
                 PT_HIPROC
                        Values in the inclusive range [PT_LOPROC, PT_HIPROC] are reserved for  processor-
                        specific semantics.

                 PT_GNU_STACK
                        GNU extension which is used by the Linux kernel to control the state of the stack
                        via the flags set in the p_flags member.

       p_offset
              This  member holds the offset from the beginning of the file at which the first byte of the
              segment resides.

       p_vaddr
              This member holds the virtual address at which the first byte of  the  segment  resides  in
              memory.

       p_paddr
              On  systems for which physical addressing is relevant, this member is reserved for the seg‐
              ment's physical address.  Under BSD this member is not used and must be zero.

       p_filesz
              This member holds the number of bytes in the file image of the segment.  It may be zero.

       p_memsz
              This member holds the number of bytes in the memory image of the segment.  It may be zero.

       p_flags
              This member holds a bit mask of flags relevant to the segment:

              PF_X   An executable segment.
              PF_W   A writable segment.
              PF_R   A readable segment.

              A text segment commonly has the flags PF_X and PF_R.  A data segment commonly has PF_W  and
              PF_R.

       p_align
              This  member  holds  the value to which the segments are aligned in memory and in the file.
              Loadable process segments must have congruent values for p_vaddr and p_offset,  modulo  the
              page  size.   Values  of  zero  and  one mean no alignment is required.  Otherwise, p_align
              should be a positive, integral power of two, and  p_vaddr  should  equal  p_offset,  modulo
              p_align.

   Section header (Shdr)
       A  file's  section header table lets one locate all the file's sections.  The section header table
       is an array of Elf32_Shdr or Elf64_Shdr structures.  The ELF header's  e_shoff  member  gives  the
       byte  offset from the beginning of the file to the section header table.  e_shnum holds the number
       of entries the section header table contains.  e_shentsize holds the size in bytes of each entry.

       A section header table index is a subscript into this array.  Some section  header  table  indices
       are reserved: the initial entry and the indices between SHN_LORESERVE and SHN_HIRESERVE.  The ini‐
       tial  entry  is  used in ELF extensions for e_phnum, e_shnum, and e_shstrndx; in other cases, each
       field in the initial entry is set to zero.  An object file does not have sections for  these  spe‐
       cial indices:

       SHN_UNDEF
              This value marks an undefined, missing, irrelevant, or otherwise meaningless section refer‐
              ence.

       SHN_LORESERVE
              This value specifies the lower bound of the range of reserved indices.

       SHN_LOPROC
       SHN_HIPROC
              Values  greater in the inclusive range [SHN_LOPROC, SHN_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-
              specific semantics.

       SHN_ABS
              This value specifies the absolute value for the corresponding reference.   For  example,  a
              symbol defined relative to section number SHN_ABS has an absolute value and is not affected
              by relocation.

       SHN_COMMON
              Symbols  defined relative to this section are common symbols, such as FORTRAN COMMON or un‐
              allocated C external variables.

       SHN_HIRESERVE
              This value specifies the upper bound of the range of reserved indices.  The system reserves
              indices between SHN_LORESERVE and SHN_HIRESERVE, inclusive.  The section header table  does
              not contain entries for the reserved indices.

       The section header has the following structure:

           typedef struct {
               uint32_t   sh_name;
               uint32_t   sh_type;
               uint32_t   sh_flags;
               Elf32_Addr sh_addr;
               Elf32_Off  sh_offset;
               uint32_t   sh_size;
               uint32_t   sh_link;
               uint32_t   sh_info;
               uint32_t   sh_addralign;
               uint32_t   sh_entsize;
           } Elf32_Shdr;

           typedef struct {
               uint32_t   sh_name;
               uint32_t   sh_type;
               uint64_t   sh_flags;
               Elf64_Addr sh_addr;
               Elf64_Off  sh_offset;
               uint64_t   sh_size;
               uint32_t   sh_link;
               uint32_t   sh_info;
               uint64_t   sh_addralign;
               uint64_t   sh_entsize;
           } Elf64_Shdr;

       No real differences exist between the 32-bit and 64-bit section headers.

       sh_name
              This  member  specifies  the  name  of the section.  Its value is an index into the section
              header string table section, giving the location of a null-terminated string.

       sh_type
              This member categorizes the section's contents and semantics.

              SHT_NULL
                     This value marks the section header as inactive.  It does  not  have  an  associated
                     section.  Other members of the section header have undefined values.

              SHT_PROGBITS
                     This  section holds information defined by the program, whose format and meaning are
                     determined solely by the program.

              SHT_SYMTAB
                     This section holds a symbol table.  Typically, SHT_SYMTAB provides symbols for  link
                     editing,  though  it may also be used for dynamic linking.  As a complete symbol ta‐
                     ble, it may contain many symbols unnecessary for dynamic linking.   An  object  file
                     can also contain a SHT_DYNSYM section.

              SHT_STRTAB
                     This  section  holds  a string table.  An object file may have multiple string table
                     sections.

              SHT_RELA
                     This section holds relocation entries with explicit addends, such as type Elf32_Rela
                     for the 32-bit class of object files.  An object may have multiple  relocation  sec‐
                     tions.

              SHT_HASH
                     This  section holds a symbol hash table.  An object participating in dynamic linking
                     must contain a symbol hash table.  An object file may have only one hash table.

              SHT_DYNAMIC
                     This section holds information for dynamic linking.  An object file  may  have  only
                     one dynamic section.

              SHT_NOTE
                     This section holds notes (ElfN_Nhdr).

              SHT_NOBITS
                     A  section  of  this  type  occupies  no  space  in the file but otherwise resembles
                     SHT_PROGBITS.  Although this section contains no bytes, the  sh_offset  member  con‐
                     tains the conceptual file offset.

              SHT_REL
                     This  section  holds  relocation  offsets  without  explicit  addends,  such as type
                     Elf32_Rel for the 32-bit class of object files.  An object file  may  have  multiple
                     relocation sections.

              SHT_SHLIB
                     This section is reserved but has unspecified semantics.

              SHT_DYNSYM
                     This  section  holds  a  minimal set of dynamic linking symbols.  An object file can
                     also contain a SHT_SYMTAB section.

              SHT_LOPROC
              SHT_HIPROC
                     Values in the inclusive range [SHT_LOPROC, SHT_HIPROC] are reserved  for  processor-
                     specific semantics.

              SHT_LOUSER
                     This  value  specifies the lower bound of the range of indices reserved for applica‐
                     tion programs.

              SHT_HIUSER
                     This value specifies the upper bound of the range of indices reserved  for  applica‐
                     tion  programs.   Section types between SHT_LOUSER and SHT_HIUSER may be used by the
                     application, without conflicting  with  current  or  future  system-defined  section
                     types.

       sh_flags
              Sections  support  one-bit  flags that describe miscellaneous attributes.  If a flag bit is
              set in sh_flags, the attribute is "on" for the section.  Otherwise, the attribute is  "off"
              or does not apply.  Undefined attributes are set to zero.

              SHF_WRITE
                     This section contains data that should be writable during process execution.

              SHF_ALLOC
                     This section occupies memory during process execution.  Some control sections do not
                     reside  in the memory image of an object file.  This attribute is off for those sec‐
                     tions.

              SHF_EXECINSTR
                     This section contains executable machine instructions.

              SHF_MASKPROC
                     All bits included in this mask are reserved for processor-specific semantics.

       sh_addr
              If this section appears in the memory image of a process, this member holds the address  at
              which the section's first byte should reside.  Otherwise, the member contains zero.

       sh_offset
              This  member's value holds the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the first byte
              in the section.  One section type, SHT_NOBITS, occupies no  space  in  the  file,  and  its
              sh_offset member locates the conceptual placement in the file.

       sh_size
              This  member holds the section's size in bytes.  Unless the section type is SHT_NOBITS, the
              section occupies sh_size bytes in the file.  A  section  of  type  SHT_NOBITS  may  have  a
              nonzero size, but it occupies no space in the file.

       sh_link
              This  member  holds  a section header table index link, whose interpretation depends on the
              section type.

       sh_info
              This member holds extra information, whose interpretation depends on the section type.

       sh_addralign
              Some sections have address alignment constraints.  If a section  holds  a  doubleword,  the
              system  must  ensure  doubleword  alignment  for the entire section.  That is, the value of
              sh_addr must be congruent to zero, modulo the value of sh_addralign.  Only zero  and  posi‐
              tive  integral  powers  of two are allowed.  The value 0 or 1 means that the section has no
              alignment constraints.

       sh_entsize
              Some sections hold a table of fixed-sized entries, such as a symbol table.  For such a sec‐
              tion, this member gives the size in bytes for each entry.  This member contains zero if the
              section does not hold a table of fixed-size entries.

       Various sections hold program and control information:

       .bss   This section holds uninitialized data that contributes to the program's memory  image.   By
              definition,  the  system  initializes  the  data with zeros when the program begins to run.
              This section is of type SHT_NOBITS.  The attribute types are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_WRITE.

       .comment

       .init  This section holds executable instructions that contribute to  the  process  initialization
              code.  When a program starts to run the system arranges to execute the code in this section
              before  calling  the  main program entry point.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The
              attributes used are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR.

       .interp
              This section holds the pathname of a program interpreter.  If the file has a loadable  seg‐
              ment  that  includes  the section, the section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit.
              Otherwise, that bit will be off.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.

       .line  This section holds line number information for symbolic debugging, which describes the cor‐
              respondence between the program source and the machine code.  The contents are unspecified.

              the  operating  system  name  and its run-time versions.  This section is of type SHT_NOTE.
              The only attribute used is SHF_ALLOC.

       .note.gnu.build-id
              This section is used to hold an ID that uniquely identifies the contents of the ELF  image.
              Different files with the same build ID should contain the same executable content.  See the
              --build-id  option  to  the  GNU linker (ld (1)) for more details.  This section is of type
              SHT_NOTE.  The only attribute used is SHF_ALLOC.

       .note.GNU-stack
              This section is used in Linux object files for declaring stack attributes.  This section is
              of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The only attribute used is SHF_EXECINSTR.  This indicates to the GNU
              linker that the object file requires an executable stack.

       .note.openbsd.ident
              OpenBSD native executables usually contain this section to identify themselves so the  ker‐
              nel can bypass any compatibility ELF binary emulation tests when loading the file.

       .plt   This section holds the procedure linkage table.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The
              attributes are processor-specific.

       .relNAME
              This  section  holds relocation information as described below.  If the file has a loadable
              segment that includes relocation, the section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC  bit.
              Otherwise,  the bit will be off.  By convention, "NAME" is supplied by the section to which
              the relocations apply.  Thus a relocation section for .text normally would  have  the  name
              .rel.text.  This section is of type SHT_REL.

       .relaNAME
              This  section  holds relocation information as described below.  If the file has a loadable
              segment that includes relocation, the section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC  bit.
              Otherwise,  the bit will be off.  By convention, "NAME" is supplied by the section to which
              the relocations apply.  Thus a relocation section for .text normally would  have  the  name
              .rela.text.  This section is of type SHT_RELA.

       .rodata
              This  section  holds  read-only data that typically contributes to a nonwritable segment in
              the process image.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attribute used is SHF_ALLOC.

       .rodata1
              This section holds read-only data that typically contributes to a  nonwritable  segment  in
              the process image.  This section is of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attribute used is SHF_ALLOC.

       .shstrtab
              This  section holds section names.  This section is of type SHT_STRTAB.  No attribute types
              are used.

       .strtab
              This section holds strings, most commonly the strings that represent the  names  associated
              with  symbol  table  entries.   If the file has a loadable segment that includes the symbol
              string table, the section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit.  Otherwise, the  bit
              will be off.  This section is of type SHT_STRTAB.

       .symtab
              This  section  holds  a symbol table.  If the file has a loadable segment that includes the
              symbol table, the section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit.  Otherwise, the  bit
              will be off.  This section is of type SHT_SYMTAB.

       .text  This  section  holds the "text", or executable instructions, of a program.  This section is
              of type SHT_PROGBITS.  The attributes used are SHF_ALLOC and SHF_EXECINSTR.

   String and symbol tables
       String table sections hold null-terminated character sequences, commonly called strings.  The  ob‐
       ject file uses these strings to represent symbol and section names.  One references a string as an
       index  into  the  string table section.  The first byte, which is index zero, is defined to hold a
       null byte ('\0').  Similarly, a string table's last byte is defined to hold a null byte,  ensuring
       null termination for all strings.

       An object file's symbol table holds information needed to locate and relocate a program's symbolic
       definitions and references.  A symbol table index is a subscript into this array.

           typedef struct {
               uint32_t      st_name;
               Elf32_Addr    st_value;
               uint32_t      st_size;
               unsigned char st_info;
               unsigned char st_other;
               uint16_t      st_shndx;

           typedef struct {
               uint32_t      st_name;
               unsigned char st_info;
               unsigned char st_other;
               uint16_t      st_shndx;

       The 32-bit and 64-bit versions have the same members, just in a different order.

       st_name
              This  member holds an index into the object file's symbol string table, which holds charac‐
              ter representations of the symbol names.  If the value is nonzero, it represents  a  string
              table index that gives the symbol name.  Otherwise, the symbol has no name.

       st_value
              This member gives the value of the associated symbol.

       st_size
              Many symbols have associated sizes.  This member holds zero if the symbol has no size or an
              unknown size.

       st_info
              This member specifies the symbol's type and binding attributes:

              STT_NOTYPE
                     The symbol's type is not defined.

              STT_OBJECT
                     The symbol is associated with a data object.

              STT_FUNC
                     The symbol is associated with a function or other executable code.

              STT_SECTION
                     The  symbol  is  associated with a section.  Symbol table entries of this type exist
                     primarily for relocation and normally have STB_LOCAL bindings.

              STT_FILE
                     By convention, the symbol's name gives the name of the source file  associated  with
                     the  object  file.   A  file  symbol  has  STB_LOCAL  bindings, its section index is
                     SHN_ABS, and it precedes the other STB_LOCAL symbols of the file, if it is present.

              STT_LOPROC
              STT_HIPROC
                     Values in the inclusive range [STT_LOPROC, STT_HIPROC] are reserved  for  processor-
                     specific semantics.

              STB_LOCAL
                     Local  symbols  are not visible outside the object file containing their definition.
                     Local symbols of the same name may exist in multiple files without interfering  with
                     each other.

              STB_GLOBAL
                     Global  symbols  are visible to all object files being combined.  One file's defini‐
                     tion of a global symbol will satisfy another file's undefined reference to the  same
                     symbol.

              STB_WEAK
                     Weak symbols resemble global symbols, but their definitions have lower precedence.

              STB_LOPROC
              STB_HIPROC
                     Values  in  the inclusive range [STB_LOPROC, STB_HIPROC] are reserved for processor-
                     specific semantics.

              There are macros for packing and unpacking the binding and type fields:

              ELF32_ST_BIND(info)
              ELF64_ST_BIND(info)
                     Extract a binding from an st_info value.

              ELF32_ST_TYPE(info)
              ELF64_ST_TYPE(info)
                     Extract a type from an st_info value.

              ELF32_ST_INFO(bind, type)
              ELF64_ST_INFO(bind, type)
                     Convert a binding and a type into an st_info value.

       st_other
              This member defines the symbol visibility.

              STV_DEFAULT
                     Default symbol visibility rules.  Global and weak symbols  are  available  to  other
                     modules;  references  in  the local module can be interposed by definitions in other
                     modules.
              STV_INTERNAL
                     Processor-specific hidden class.
              STV_HIDDEN
                     Symbol is unavailable to other modules; references in the local  module  always  re‐
                     solve  to  the  local symbol (i.e., the symbol can't be interposed by definitions in
                     other modules).
              STV_PROTECTED
                     Symbol is available to other modules, but references in the local module always  re‐
                     solve to the local symbol.

              There are macros for extracting the visibility type:

              ELF32_ST_VISIBILITY(other) or ELF64_ST_VISIBILITY(other)

       st_shndx
              Every  symbol  table entry is "defined" in relation to some section.  This member holds the
              relevant section header table index.

   Relocation entries (Rel & Rela)
       Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with symbolic  definitions.   Relocat‐
       able  files must have information that describes how to modify their section contents, thus allow‐
       ing executable and shared object files to hold the right information for a process's  program  im‐
       age.  Relocation entries are these data.

       Relocation structures that do not need an addend:

           typedef struct {
               Elf32_Addr r_offset;
               uint32_t   r_info;
           } Elf32_Rel;

           typedef struct {
               Elf64_Addr r_offset;
               uint64_t   r_info;
           } Elf64_Rel;

       Relocation structures that need an addend:

           typedef struct {
               Elf32_Addr r_offset;
               uint32_t   r_info;
               int32_t    r_addend;
           } Elf32_Rela;

           typedef struct {
               Elf64_Addr r_offset;
               uint64_t   r_info;
               int64_t    r_addend;
           } Elf64_Rela;

       r_offset
              This  member gives the location at which to apply the relocation action.  For a relocatable
              file, the value is the byte offset from the beginning of the section to  the  storage  unit
              affected by the relocation.  For an executable file or shared object, the value is the vir‐
              tual address of the storage unit affected by the relocation.

       r_info This  member gives both the symbol table index with respect to which the relocation must be
              made and the type of relocation to apply.  Relocation types are  processor-specific.   When
              the text refers to a relocation entry's relocation type or symbol table index, it means the
              result  of  applying  ELF[32|64]_R_TYPE  or  ELF[32|64]_R_SYM, respectively, to the entry's
              r_info member.

       r_addend
              This member specifies a constant addend used to compute the value to be stored into the re‐
              locatable field.

   Dynamic tags (Dyn)
       The .dynamic section contains a series of structures that hold relevant dynamic  linking  informa‐
       tion.  The d_tag member controls the interpretation of d_un.

           typedef struct {
               Elf32_Sword    d_tag;
               union {
                   Elf32_Word d_val;
                   Elf32_Addr d_ptr;
               } d_un;
           } Elf32_Dyn;
           extern Elf32_Dyn _DYNAMIC[];

           typedef struct {
               Elf64_Sxword    d_tag;
               union {
                   Elf64_Xword d_val;
                   Elf64_Addr  d_ptr;
               } d_un;
           } Elf64_Dyn;
           extern Elf64_Dyn _DYNAMIC[];

       d_tag  This member may have any of the following values:

              DT_NULL     Marks end of dynamic section

              DT_NEEDED   String table offset to name of a needed library

              DT_PLTRELSZ Size in bytes of PLT relocation entries

              DT_PLTGOT   Address of PLT and/or GOT

              DT_HASH     Address of symbol hash table

              DT_STRTAB   Address of string table

              DT_SYMTAB   Address of symbol table

              DT_RELA     Address of Rela relocation table

              DT_RELASZ   Size in bytes of the Rela relocation table

              DT_RELAENT  Size in bytes of a Rela relocation table entry

              DT_STRSZ    Size in bytes of string table

              DT_SYMENT   Size in bytes of a symbol table entry

              DT_INIT     Address of the initialization function

              DT_FINI     Address of the termination function

              DT_SONAME   String table offset to name of shared object

              DT_RPATH    String table offset to library search path (deprecated)

              DT_SYMBOLIC Alert linker to search this shared object before the executable for symbols

              DT_REL      Address of Rel relocation table

              DT_RELSZ    Size in bytes of Rel relocation table

              DT_RELENT   Size in bytes of a Rel table entry

              DT_PLTREL   Type of relocation entry to which the PLT refers (Rela or Rel)

              DT_DEBUG    Undefined use for debugging

              DT_TEXTREL  Absence  of  this  entry indicates that no relocation entries should apply to a
                          nonwritable segment

              DT_JMPREL   Address of relocation entries associated solely with the PLT

              DT_BIND_NOW Instruct dynamic linker to process all relocations before transferring  control
                          to the executable

              DT_RUNPATH  String table offset to library search path

              DT_LOPROC
              DT_HIPROC   Values  in  the inclusive range [DT_LOPROC, DT_HIPROC] are reserved for proces‐
                          sor-specific semantics

       d_val  This member represents integer values with various interpretations.

       d_ptr  This member represents program virtual addresses.  When interpreting these  addresses,  the
              actual address should be computed based on the original file value and memory base address.
              Files do not contain relocation entries to fixup these addresses.

       _DYNAMIC
              Array containing all the dynamic structures in the .dynamic section.  This is automatically
              populated by the linker.

   Notes (Nhdr)
       ELF  notes allow for appending arbitrary information for the system to use.  They are largely used
       by core files (e_type of ET_CORE), but many projects define their own set of extensions.  For  ex‐
       ample, the GNU tool chain uses ELF notes to pass information from the linker to the C library.

       Note sections contain a series of notes (see the struct definitions below).  Each note is followed
       by  the  name  field (whose length is defined in n_namesz) and then by the descriptor field (whose
       length is defined in n_descsz) and whose starting address has a 4 byte alignment.   Neither  field
       is defined in the note struct due to their arbitrary lengths.

       An example for parsing out two consecutive notes should clarify their layout in memory:

           void *memory, *name, *desc;
           Elf64_Nhdr *note, *next_note;

           /* The buffer is pointing to the start of the section/segment. */
           note = memory;

           /* If the name is defined, it follows the note. */
           name = note->n_namesz == 0 ? NULL : memory + sizeof(*note);

           /* If the descriptor is defined, it follows the name
              (with alignment). */

           desc = note->n_descsz == 0 ? NULL :
                  memory + sizeof(*note) + ALIGN_UP(note->n_namesz, 4);

           /* The next note follows both (with alignment). */
           next_note = memory + sizeof(*note) +
                                ALIGN_UP(note->n_namesz, 4) +
                                ALIGN_UP(note->n_descsz, 4);

       Keep  in  mind  that the interpretation of n_type depends on the namespace defined by the n_namesz
       field.  If the n_namesz field is not set (e.g., is 0), then there are two sets of notes:  one  for
       core  files and one for all other ELF types.  If the namespace is unknown, then tools will usually
       fallback to these sets of notes as well.

           typedef struct {
               Elf32_Word n_namesz;
               Elf32_Word n_descsz;
               Elf32_Word n_type;
           } Elf32_Nhdr;

           typedef struct {
               Elf64_Word n_namesz;
               Elf64_Word n_descsz;
               Elf64_Word n_type;
           } Elf64_Nhdr;

       n_namesz
              The length of the name field in bytes.  The contents will immediately follow this  note  in
              memory.   The  name  is  null terminated.  For example, if the name is "GNU", then n_namesz
              will be set to 4.

       n_descsz
              The length of the descriptor field in bytes.  The contents will immediately follow the name
              field in memory.

       n_type Depending on the value of the name field, this member may have any of the following values:

              Core files (e_type = ET_CORE)
                   Notes used by all core files.  These are highly operating system or architecture  spe‐
                   cific  and  often require close coordination with kernels, C libraries, and debuggers.
                   These are used when the namespace is the default (i.e., n_namesz will be set to 0), or
                   a fallback when the namespace is unknown.

                   NT_GNU_ABI_TAG
                          Operating system (OS) ABI information.  The desc field will be 4 words:

                          [0]  OS descriptor (ELF_NOTE_OS_LINUX, ELF_NOTE_OS_GNU, and so on)`
                          [1]  major version of the ABI
                          [2]  minor version of the ABI
                          [3]  subminor version of the ABI

                   NT_GNU_HWCAP
                          Synthetic hwcap information.  The desc field begins with two words:

                          [0]  number of entries
                          [1]  bit mask of enabled entries

                          Then follow variable-length entries, one byte followed by a null-terminated hw‐
                          cap name string.  The byte gives the bit number to test if enabled, (1U << bit)
                          & bit mask.

                   NT_GNU_BUILD_ID
                          Unique build ID as generated by the GNU ld(1) --build-id option.  The desc con‐
                          sists of any nonzero number of bytes.

                   NT_GNU_GOLD_VERSION
                          The desc contains the GNU Gold linker version used.

              Default/unknown namespace (e_type != ET_CORE)
                   These are used when the namespace is the default (i.e., n_namesz will be set to 0), or
                   a fallback when the namespace is unknown.

                   NT_VERSION  A version string of some sort.
                   NT_ARCH     Architecture information.

NOTES
       ELF first appeared in System V.  The ELF format is an adopted standard.

       The extensions for e_phnum, e_shnum, and e_shstrndx respectively are Linux extensions.  Sun,  BSD,
       and AMD64 also support them; for further information, look under SEE ALSO.
